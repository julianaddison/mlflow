# Utilising MLflow for Experiment Tracking
For the purpose of the experiment, a time series model is trained. An XGBoost is tuned with several different hyperparameters using time series cross validation on SkLearn. All metrics are logged in the MLflow server. 

## Setup
1. Setup MLflow in Databricks:
Follow the [link](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html), and complete the signing up process.

2. Login to databricks which should bring you to this page. On the left pane, go to `Machine Learning` > `Experiments` then `Create Experiment` on the top right.
